          <p class="justify-content-center" style="color: #000;">SPIC MACAY (Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music And Culture Amongst Youth) is a non-political, nationwide, voluntary movement founded in 1977 by Dr Kiran Seth, Professor-Emeritus at IIT-Delhi who was awarded the ‘Padma Shri’ for his contribution to the arts in 2009. <br><br>
The  intention is to enrich the quality of formal education by spreading awareness about different aspects of Indian heritage and inspiring the young minds to imbibe the values embedded in it. It seeks to inspire youth through experiencing the mysticism embodied in the rich and heterogeneous cultural tapestry of Indian and World Heritage, with a hope that the beauty, grace, values and wisdom embodied in these arts will influence their way of life and thinking. For this, the most accomplished artistes of the country render programmes of Indian classical music and dance, folk, poetry, theatre, traditional paintings, crafts & yoga primarily in schools and colleges. In 2011, SPIC MACAY was awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Sadbhavana Award in recognition of its contribution to youth development.<br><Br>
In 2012-13, 7500+ programmes were organised in more than 1500 institutions in 800 towns in India and 50 towns abroad impacting more than 3 million students. All these programmes were organised by thousands of volunteers – largely students, teachers, housewives, retired people, professionals, young and old. SPIC MACAY celebrates Nishkaam Seva - the spirit of volunteerism – of giving selflessly without expectation, a value that is intrinsic to our culture and important to nurture in todays'  world.<br><br>
 
SPIC MACAY is an affirmation of:-<br>
●	a priceless cultural heritage. SPIC MACAY seeks to conserve and promote an awareness of the rich and heterogeneous cultural tapestry amongst the youth of our country through focus on classical arts  with their attendant legends and philosophy and to facilitate an awareness of their deeper and subtler values.<br>
●	the pulsating and dynamic vitality of young people. The movement incorporates this vitality to cajole them into being custodian of what is actually their birthright, namely their heritage, roots and identity. It seeks to provoke thought and a genuine spirit of enquiry in the young.<br>
●	a solid value-based education, which involves the absorption of aesthetics and spirituality in an increasingly technical, mundane and competitive world. Thus its work is educational in spirit and character and locates itself largely in educational institutions.<br>
●	the effectiveness of voluntary work in inculcating a spirit of service. This is, in fact, the hidden agenda of this movement. Volunteers come from all walks of life with varied aspirations and skills. They give some of their time to a cause for the larger good and outside of their immediate self interest. The emphasis is on participation without hierarchy or formalism.<br>
●	the need for a more inspired and holistic perspective in a world bombarded by too much information. A unique feature of the heritage of India is its in-built characteristic of introspection and a philosophy that transcends mere intellectualism.<br>
●	all that is beautiful, lofty and wholesome, of the sensitive, kind and gentle human being who is inspired and in turn inspires.<br><br>
SPIC MACAY introduced of the lec-dem (lecture-demonstration) format to present Indian classical art forms in a comprehensive manner in front of youth, which has given them an understanding of the basics of the classical art forms, and done away with the misconception that classical arts are difficult to understand. To give our artistes a chance to undertake an inward journey and reach depths of performance (taking us along too), we endeavour to organise performances in an ambience conducive for touching the highest heights, both by the artists and the rasikas.
SPIC MACAY is a non-profit, voluntary, non-political and participatory student movement registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and gets the benefit of Section 80(G) tax exemption under the IT Act 1961. People from all walks of life are welcome to join and contribute with their ideas, time, finance or any other resources. The movement has a central executive body in New Delhi and organises its programmes through a worldwide network of schools, colleges and educational institutions. Apart from many well-wishers (corporates, individuals, charitable trusts, etc), SPIC MACAY is supported nationally by the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and the HRD Ministry. Internationally, SPIC MACAY is recognised and supported by Rikskonsertene (Norway) and Goethe Institute (Germany) which enable conducting of 300+ concerts by Indian artistes in Scandinavia and Germany, and 200+ concerts by international classical artistes across India.<br><br><br><br>

        <div class="row">
          <p class="justify-content-center" style="color: #000;">SPIC MACAY NIT Silchar Chapter came into existence under the persistent support and guidance of Dr. Wasim Arif, Assistant Professor, Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT Silchar and Prof. Rahul Dev Misra, Dean (Students' Welfare), NIT Silchar and the extraordinary efforts and hard work put in by the Gymkhana Students' Union Body 2019-20.<br><br>
SPIC MACAY NIT Silchar Chapter was formed to generate and develop interest about the different aspects of Indian Culture and Heritage among the students of NIT Silchar and the neighboring educational institutes in the Barak Valley. To achieve its goal SPIC MACAY Heritage Club organizes events ranging from classical music and dance program to classic film screenings and MIME workshop. SPIC MACAY aims to bring about a change in attitude among youth towards the rich Indian culture and to create and sense of respect and appreciation towards it. <br><br>
The NIT Silchar chapter of SPIC MACAY is in its elementary stage and has just formed this year. Since it is a new initiative, we would require a lot of effort and enthusiasm to make it an accepted club in not only NIT Silchar but the entire country.
